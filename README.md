Introduction to JavaScript :-**
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used to enhance web pages and applications. 
It allows developers to create interactive elements, handle events, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
With a vast ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, JavaScript has evolved into a key language for both front-end and back-end development (thanks to environments like Node.js).
